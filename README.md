# Food-And-Beverages-Sales-Analysis

This project is focused on analysing sales data and providing insights for a fictious e-commerce Food and Beverage company using the power bi tool to clean transform and visualise its dataset.

**Business Questions and dashboard Insights ->**

Q: What are the core business metrics that should appear upfront for rapid insight?
A: Implemented three KPI cards displaying Total Revenue, Total Orders, and Average Ticket Size, positioned at the top of the report for immediate visibility.

Q: Which sales channels (Online, Retail, Distributor) contribute most to revenue?
A: Created a donut chart titled “Revenue by Channel” to display each channel’s revenue share, enabling clear comparative insight at a glance.

Q: How do product categories compare in terms of revenue?
A: Added a bar chart showing Total Revenue by Product Category, sorted descending to easily highlight top-performing categories.

Q: What are the monthly and quarterly trends in revenue?
A: Designed two combo charts:
      Monthly: Displays revenue (bars) and order counts (line)
      Quarterly: Condensed version showing quarterly performance
  These visuals support trend analysis and seasonality insights.

Q: How can individual salesperson performance be evaluated?
A: Built a Salesperson Summary table summarizing each team member’s Order Count, Average Ticket, and Total Revenue. A slicer enables interactive filtering by salesperson.

Q: How can users dynamically explore data by category, channel, date, and salesperson?
A: Integrated slicers for Product Category, Sales Channel, and Quarter. These filters dynamically update all visuals for custom analysis.
